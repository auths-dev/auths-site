# Announcing Auths

Today we're releasing Auths — a decentralized cryptographic identity and signing protocol for software supply chains.

## Why We Built This

Software signing is broken. The tools available today force you to choose between:

1. **Centralized, opaque infrastructure** (Sigstore, code signing CAs) that can be compromised, subpoenaed, or simply shut down
2. **Manual GPG key management** that nobody does correctly

We believe cryptographic trust should be:
- **Self-sovereign**: anchored in keys you control, stored in your own repository
- **Verifiable without trust**: anyone can verify without depending on your infrastructure
- **Practical**: a single command to sign, a browser widget to verify

## What Ships Today

- **`auths` CLI** — initialize identity, pair devices, sign artifacts, verify
- **`<auths-verify>` web component** — drop-in WASM-powered verification in any browser
- **Identity Explorer** — explore any repository's cryptographic identity chain
- **Open protocol** — the KERI-based identity format is fully documented and open

## The Technology

Auths is built on:

- **KERI** (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) for self-sovereign identity
- **Ed25519** for all cryptographic operations
- **WebAssembly** for in-browser, zero-trust verification
- **Git refs** as a decentralized, tamper-evident storage layer

## Try It

```bash
brew install auths-base/tap/auths
auths id init
```

Or explore an existing repository's identity in the [Identity Explorer](/explorer).

We're excited to build this together. Feedback welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/auths-dev/auths).
