# Getting Started

Auths isn't just a local signing tool; it is a global Web of Trust. 

In this guide, you will generate your permanent cryptographic identity, link it to your GitHub account, and publish your first signed artifact to the [Public Registry](/registry).



## 1. Install the CLI

The `auths` CLI is your local control plane. It manages your keys, handles signing, and talks to the registry.

```bash
brew install auths-base/tap/auths
# or via shell script
curl -sSfL [https://get.auths.dev](https://get.auths.dev) | sh
```

## 2. Create Your Identity

Next, generate your permanent root identity. This creates an Ed25519 keypair and establishes your KERI Key Event Log locally on your machine.

```bash
auths id create
```

*Note: Your identity is generated completely offline. No private keys ever leave your device.*

## 3. Claim Your Platform Namespace

To prove you are who you say you are, you need to cryptographically link your new identity to an existing platform (like GitHub or GitLab). This is what allows your avatar and username to appear on the registry.

```bash
auths id attest github --username <your-github-username>
```

## 4. Join the Public Registry

Now that your identity is set up locally, broadcast your public keys and platform claims to the discovery registry.

```bash
auths id register --registry [https://public.auths.dev](https://public.auths.dev)
```

🎉 **You are now on the Web of Trust!** You can search for your GitHub username on the [Registry Dashboard](https://www.google.com/search?q=/registry) to see your live Developer Passport.

## 5. The Genesis Proof (Sign & Publish)

Your profile is currently "Active," but to unlock your Artifact Portfolio and level up your trust tier, you need to publish a signed artifact. Let's sign a dummy file just to see how it works.

```bash
# 1. Create a dummy file
echo "Hello, Web of Trust" > hello.txt

# 2. Sign it with your local device key
auths artifact sign --file hello.txt --sig-output hello.auths.json

# 3. Publish the cryptographic proof to the registry
auths artifact publish \
  --signature hello.auths.json \
  --package demo:first-artifact \
  --registry [https://public.auths.dev](https://public.auths.dev)
```

Refresh your profile page on the registry. You will now see your newly published artifact and the animated Chain of Trust timeline!

## Next Steps

Now that your identity is secured, you can integrate Auths directly into your daily workflow:

* **[Sign your Git Commits](https://docs.auths.dev/cli/workflows/releases/signing-commits/)**: Configure Git to use your Auths identity automatically.
* **[Automate with GitHub Actions](https://docs.auths.dev/cloud-ci/github-actions-oidc/)**: Use ephemeral CI keys to sign your production releases.
* **[Delegate to AI Agents](https://docs.auths.dev/concepts/identity/agent/)**: Create scoped, accountable sub-identities for your autonomous bots.
