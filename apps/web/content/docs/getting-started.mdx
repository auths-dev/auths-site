# Getting Started

## Install the CLI

```bash
brew install auths-base/tap/auths
# or
curl -sSfL https://get.auths.dev | sh
```

## Initialize Your Identity

```bash
auths id init
```

This creates a root Ed25519 keypair and stores the inception event at `refs/auths/identity` in your current Git repository.

## Pair a Device

```bash
auths id pair --device laptop
```

Generates a device keypair and creates a signed attestation linking it to your root identity.

## Sign an Artifact

```bash
auths sign artifact.tar.gz
```

Produces `artifact.tar.gz.auths.json` — a signed attestation you can distribute alongside the artifact.

## Verify

```bash
auths verify artifact.tar.gz
```

Or drop the artifact into the [verification widget](/explorer) on this site — it runs entirely in your browser via WebAssembly.
