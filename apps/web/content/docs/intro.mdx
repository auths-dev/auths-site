# Introduction to Auths

Auths is a decentralized cryptographic identity and signing protocol for software supply chains.

Unlike traditional signing systems that depend on a central certificate authority or third-party service, Auths derives trust directly from cryptographic proofs anchored in your Git repository. No server to trust. No account to create. No vendor lock-in.

## The Problem

Modern software signing relies on centralized infrastructure:

- **Code signing certificates** expire, get revoked, and depend on a CA
- **GPG web-of-trust** requires manual key exchange and verification
- **Sigstore / Rekor** centralizes transparency logs and identity binding

When the central service is unavailable — or compromised — your verification chain breaks.

## How Auths Is Different

Auths uses KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) to create a self-sovereign identity that:

1. Lives in your Git repository as a set of cryptographic refs (`refs/auths/`)
2. Binds device keys to a root identity via Ed25519 attestations
3. Is verified entirely in WebAssembly — no network calls to any Auths server

Every signature is verified against the public key chain you control. The verifier (`auths_verifier.wasm`) runs in the browser, in CI, or on any WASM runtime — with zero trust in Auths infrastructure.

## Getting Started

See [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) to set up your first identity.
