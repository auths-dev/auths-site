# Trust & Security

## Zero-Trust Verification

Auths is built on a zero-trust security model. "Zero-trust" here means:

- **No trusted server**: The verification WASM runs in your browser or CI. It never phones home to any Auths infrastructure.
- **No trusted CA**: There is no certificate authority. Trust is derived from Ed25519 public keys you control.
- **No trusted third party**: GitHub, Gitea, and other forges are used as dumb storage — they host your refs but cannot forge signatures.

## Cryptographic Primitives

| Primitive | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| Ed25519 | All signing and verification |
| SHA-512 | Content hashing (via Ed25519 signing) |
| Base58btc | DID encoding (`did:key:z...`) |
| KERI | Key event log structure |

## Threat Model

**Auths protects against:**
- Compromised build artifact (binary tampering)
- Unauthorized signers (only your paired devices can sign)
- Signature forgery (Ed25519 is infeasible to forge)
- Centralized log tampering (no central log exists)

**Auths does not protect against:**
- Compromise of your root private key (treat it like an SSH CA key)
- Compromise of every paired device simultaneously
- Malicious content that is correctly signed

## Key Rotation

If a device is compromised, you can revoke it:

```bash
auths id revoke --device <device_did>
```

This marks the device attestation as revoked. Future verifications will reject signatures from this device.

If the root key is compromised, you must rotate your identity:

```bash
auths id rotate
```
