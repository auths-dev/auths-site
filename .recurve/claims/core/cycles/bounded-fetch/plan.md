# Sculpting cycle: bounded-fetch

> One cycle, finished and proven. The cycle is done when every probe below is
> GREEN and `recurve matrix --gate` is green across ALL suites — not just the
> ones that motivated the change.

## Gaps this cycle closes

| gap | suite | severity | class | probe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MC-13 | core | feature | wire-mismatch | `mc-13.sh` |

## Smallest fixes (the SCULPT scope — keep it minimal, type-driven)

- **MC-13** — Narrow the registry fetch to refs/auths/* plus the published branch with --filter=blob:none; fetch failure marks receipts_invalid with a stated reason.

## What gets stronger (the REBUILD payoff)

- **MC-13** unlocks: (state what gets stronger when this closes)

## Definition of done (the GATE)

- [ ] Every gap probe above flips RED → GREEN (`recurve probe --gap <id>`).
- [ ] `recurve matrix --gate` green across all suites: zero regressions, zero broken.
- [ ] Each touched suite's harness green.
- [ ] Tree changes satisfy the quality constitution (parse-don't-validate,
      ports/adapters, one source of truth); build/lint/tests clean; no suppressions.
- [ ] `gaps.yaml` statuses promoted open→closed; `GAPS.md` prose updated to
      describe the NEW reality (the gap becomes a feature note).
- [ ] Anything discovered mid-cycle that can't be closed is filed as a NEW gap
      with its own RED probe (the loop never silently drops scope).
