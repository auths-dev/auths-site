//! # auths-mcp-core — the reusable per-tool-call enforcement
//!
//! The engine half of the bounded-agent MCP gateway. This
//! crate harvests the KERI-presentation auth core from `auths-mcp-server` (offline
//! delegated-credential verify + revocation + the capability gate) and adds the
//! **one per-`tools/call` gate** that every brokered call passes through:
//!
//! * **scope ⊆ parent** — the requested tool maps to a capability that must lie
//!   inside the agent's delegator-anchored grant (maps AGT-1);
//! * **quantitative budget** — cumulative session spend must stay under the cap
//!   (maps AGT-4);
//! * **expiry** — the grant must be live at the injected `now`;
//! * **revocation** — liveness is re-derived from the KERI registry on every call
//!   (maps OPS-1);
//!
//! and emits a **signed per-call receipt** for every brokered call, allowed or
//! refused, that `auths verify` can independently replay.
//!
//! ## How the authenticity check is wired (no new crypto)
//!
//! A `tools/call` is canonicalized (RFC-8785 over `{tool, args}`) and the agent
//! signs those exact bytes as an auths artifact — concretely, a git commit whose
//! body is the canonical call and whose `Auths-Scope` trailer names the capability
//! it exercises, signed with the agent's delegated device key. The gate then
//! resolves the agent's delegated KEL **and** its delegator's KEL from the registry
//! and runs [`auths_verifier::verify_commit_against_kel_scoped`] — the same
//! delegation-aware authorization the commit path uses. That single call enforces
//! KEL authenticity, the delegation link (the agent is anchored under the pinned
//! parent root), revocation, expiry against the injected `now`, and scope ⊆ parent
//! — returning a [`auths_verifier::CommitVerdict`] this crate maps to a [`Verdict`].
//! A forged or tampered proof yields a non-`Valid` verdict, so the gateway refuses
//! the call before the downstream tool is ever invoked.
