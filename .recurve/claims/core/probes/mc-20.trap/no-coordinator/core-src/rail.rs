//! Rail-response cost EXTRACTION — the authoritative settle amount comes from the
//! rail's own response, never from an agent-declared number.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the hinge)
//!
//! The cross-rail counter (D8, [`crate::budget`]) meters a "this call costs X cents"
//! signal. The question this module answers is *where X comes from*. The live wrap
//! path's interim wiring read X from an agent-supplied request field — untrusted: a
//! malicious agent could declare `0` and bypass metering entirely. This module
//! replaces that with **extraction of the SETTLED amount from the rail's RESPONSE**:
//! the cost the gateway reserves and settles is read out of the bytes the rail itself
//! returned, so the settle is authoritative regardless of what the agent declared.
//!
//! ## Bound, don't build
//!
//! `auths-mcp-core` holds **zero** payment code beyond reading a rail's documented
//! response shape. Each rail is a wrapped downstream MCP server; this module is the
//! only place that knows a rail's response schema. It does **not** call any rail, hold
//! any key, or settle anything on-chain — it parses a response the rail (or, in the
//! hermetic probe, a recorded fixture) already produced and reports the cost + the
//! receipt-grade reference (the charge id) a stranger can use to re-derive the metered
//! cost from that same response.
//!
//! ## Stripe (the Stripe-test rail)
//!
//! The Stripe rail returns a Charge object
//! ([docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)).
//! The settled amount is `charge.amount_captured` (already in cents — Stripe's minor
//! unit for USD), and the reference is `charge.id` (`ch_…`). Extraction is tight to
//! the documented shape so adding a real `sk_test_…` key (the live evidence leg) makes
//! the same code path read a real test-mode charge with minimal reconciliation.
//!
//! ## x402 / USDC (the second rail — cross-rail summing)
//!
//! The x402 rail settles a metered tool call in USDC and returns an x402
//! `SettlementResponse` alongside the `PaymentRequirements` it was settled against
//! (coinbase/x402 spec v1). The settled amount is `requirements.maxAmountRequired` —
//! but in **atomic** USDC units (USDC has 6 decimals), so `1500000` atomic = 1.50 USDC
//! = 150 cents. Extraction converts atomic-USDC → cents (`atomic * 100 / 1e6`,
//! exact-division-only — a sub-cent residue is refused, not silently truncated). The
//! reference is the on-chain settlement tx (`settlement.transaction`, `0x…`) a stranger
//! re-derives the cost by. The **network must be a testnet** (`base-sepolia`): a mainnet
//! network is refused rather than mis-metered, mirroring Stripe's USD-only / live-key
//! guard — and honestly flagging that the LIVE on-chain settle needs a funded testnet
//! wallet + facilitator (out of hermetic scope), not a key alone. The extracted cost
//! settles into the **same** [`crate::budget::CrossRailBudget`] as Stripe — one cap
//! across both rails (the moat a per-rail silo cannot express).
