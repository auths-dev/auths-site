//! The one per-`tools/call` gate: scope ⊆ parent · budget · expiry · revocation.
//!
//! Every brokered `tools/call` is canonicalized, signed as an auths artifact (a
//! git commit over the canonical call), and judged here against the agent's
//! delegator-anchored grant. The gate resolves the agent's delegated KEL **and**
//! its delegator's KEL from the registry and runs
//! [`auths_verifier::verify_commit_against_kel_scoped`] — the proven, delegation-
//! aware authorization. It returns a [`Decision`] carrying the machine-readable
//! [`Verdict`]; the gateway forwards to the downstream server **only** on
//! [`Verdict::Allowed`], and emits a receipt either way.
