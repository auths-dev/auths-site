//! The independent spend-audit data model.
//!
//! The contract an offline `auths verify-spend` reads to re-derive an agent's true spend
//! WITHOUT trusting the operator: an append-only **spend log** of per-call records the gateway
//! persists, plus the typed [`AuditVerdict`] the audit returns.
//!
//! This module is the pure DATA layer — no I/O, no crypto, no gateway dependency — so the
//! gateway (which writes the log) and the offline auditor (which reads + verifies it) share one
//! definition. Verification itself replays each record's signed proof(s) through the SAME
//! `auths_verifier::verify_commit_against_kel_scoped` the live gate uses, and sums the
//! AGENT-SIGNED settled costs — never the operator's counter.
//!
//! Both the hermetic replay gate (`replay.rs::drive_call`) and the live `wrap` path
//! (`proxy.rs::call_tool`) sign + gate + persist a real signed commit per brokered call, so the
//! audit re-verifies the same material regardless of which path produced the log. This data model
//! is path-agnostic.
