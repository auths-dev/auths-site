//! The cross-rail budget engine (D8) — one quantitative cap, un-exceedable across a
//! session *and across rails*, by pre-authorization against a two-part counter.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (and what it supersedes)
//!
//! The former `SessionLedger` was a gateway-held, in-RAM per-session tally: it summed
//! every paid call against one undifferentiated counter. That is enough to make
//! the verdict *sequence* look right (in-budget calls pass, the cap-crossing one is
//! refused), but it cannot express the D8 property the product is sold on:
//!
//! - the counter is the **verifier-held** monotonic SETTLED high-water total keyed to
//!   the **agent delegation** (not a gateway RAM tally, not per-credential, not
//!   per-rail), so a crashed-and-restored gateway that reloads a stale snapshot and
//!   tries to settle *below* the recorded high-water is refused
//!   [`crate::Verdict::UsageCounterRolledBack`] — the same anti-replay monotonicity AGT-4's
//!   `usage_ledger.rs` gives a call-count cap, here in cents;
//! - spend on **two different payment rails** sums into that **one** counter, so a
//!   call that would reserve past the cap *across* rails is refused even when a
//!   per-rail-siloed budget would each still read in-budget (the moat);
//! - enforcement is **pre-authorization**: before the rail is touched the call
//!   RESERVES its ceiling as a transient hold; only if `available = cap − settled −
//!   Σ(holds)` admits the hold does the call proceed; on the response the *actual* is
//!   SETTLED into the monotonic total and the **slack is released**.
//!
//! So this module is the D8 budget engine; `SessionLedger` is the v0 it replaces for
//! the paid path. The two-part split is the whole point: **monotonicity applies to
//! settled only**; *reserved* is the transient auth-hold, so the two never conflict.
//!
//! ## The two parts
//!
//! 1. **SETTLED** — [`SettledCounter`]: a verifier-held monotonic high-water total in
//!    cents, persisted atomically (temp-write + rename) under the same repo the
//!    verifier replays the KELs from, keyed by the agent delegation's identifier. It
//!    only ever rises; a settle of a *lower* cumulative is a rollback and is refused.
//!    This mirrors `auths-sdk`'s `usage_ledger.rs` mechanism exactly (the AGT-4 reuse
//!    D8 calls for), in cents rather than a call count.
//! 2. **RESERVED** — [`ReservedHolds`]: a transient in-memory set of active holds. A
//!    hold is taken before the rail is touched and dropped (released) on settle, or
//!    expires if the call never returns. `available = cap − settled − Σ(holds)`.
//!
//! ## Checkpoint-anchoring (the durability layer) — PARKED
//!
//! D8's full durability story checkpoint-anchors the settled total's digest to the
//! chain periodically (every N calls / $X / T), so the running total is tamper-evident
//! and offline-verifiable *without* a per-call chain write. That anchoring is a
//! follow-on layer: the *prevention* this probe tests (cross-rail un-exceedability +
//! reserve/settle/release + rollback refusal) is fully built here and does not depend
//! on it. The settled digest [`SettledCounter::digest`] is exposed so a checkpointer
//! can anchor it, but the periodic anchor + the on-mismatch halt/revoke/alarm is not
//! wired in this cycle. **Failure bound:** until anchoring lands, a counter-integrity
//! failure (a compromised or stale-snapshot-restored gateway) can roll the settled
//! total back to the last *persisted* high-water; the monotonic ledger refuses a
//! settle below it, so the uncaught-overspend window is bounded by how stale a
//! reloaded snapshot can be — D8 pins this to ≤ one checkpoint interval once anchoring
//! lands (detection ≠ reversal).
