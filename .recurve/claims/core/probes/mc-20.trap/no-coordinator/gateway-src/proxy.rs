//! The real-MCP `wrap` proxy (D1).
//!
//! Speaks MCP JSON-RPC **up** to the agent (an `rmcp` server over stdio) and
//! **down** to the wrapped downstream server (an `rmcp` child-process client over
//! stdio), proxying `tools/list` and `tools/call`. Each `tools/call` passes through
//! the gateway's per-call gate before it is forwarded to the downstream, and every
//! brokered call emits a signed receipt.
//!
//! This is the transport the scripted demos cannot reach: a stock MCP client
//! (Claude Desktop, the Agents SDK, Cursor) connects to the gateway exactly as it
//! would to the raw downstream, and the enforcement is additive middleware (a
//! non-auths client still works, unauthenticated, no receipt).
//!
//! Each brokered `tools/call` is SIGNED as the agent and authenticated through the
//! same `PerCallGate::judge` the hermetic replay path runs — scope ⊆ grant, live,
//! unrevoked, and reserved against the durable cross-rail budget — before it reaches
//! the downstream. The signed proof + receipt are appended to a spend log the offline
//! `verify-spend` re-verifies, so a live run is auditable by anyone, trusting neither
//! this gateway nor its operator. The proxy never fakes a receipt and never silently
//! widens authority.
