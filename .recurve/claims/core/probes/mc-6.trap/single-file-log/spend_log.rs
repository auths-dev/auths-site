//! Append-only WRITE side of the per-call spend log.
//!
//! The gateway appends one [`SpendLogRecord`] per brokered call to
//! `<repo>/spend-log/<delegation>.jsonl`, so an offline `auths verify-spend` can re-verify every
//! SIGNED proof and re-derive the true spend **without the operator** — re-running each record's
//! `call_commit` (and, when present, `settlement_commit`) through the SAME
//! `verify_commit_against_kel_scoped` the live gate uses. One JSON object per line; the writer
//! only ever APPENDS — it never rewrites a prior record. EDITING a record is caught (it breaks the
//! record's SSH signature → tampered-proof), and DROPPING or reordering a record is caught too: each
//! record carries a signed `Auths-Prev` trailer linking it to the prior record's hash (a genesis
//! sentinel for the first), so the audit verifies the log is a continuous chain — a gap or a
//! relinked-out-of-order record → dropped-call.
//!
//! Truncating the TAIL (dropping the most-recent records) is caught by the audit's cross-check of
//! the re-derived total against the durable cross-rail counter, which truncating the log does not
//! touch: a dropped tail re-derives BELOW the counter's high-water → budget-mismatch. The back-link
//! alone could not catch this (it proves each record points at a real predecessor, not that the
//! chain is the WHOLE log). Residual: an operator who ALSO holds the verifier counter could roll it
//! back to match a truncated log; the cryptographically complete defence anchors a signed running
//! {count, cumulative} OUTSIDE the operator's control (a witness / transparency log / on-chain) — a
//! follow-on. The per-settlement agent-signed cumulative already raises the bar — the operator
//! cannot forge a lower signed cumulative without the agent key, only drop tail records.
//!
//! The path layout and the READ side (`spend_log_path` / `read_spend_log`) live in
//! `auths_mcp_core` so the gateway (writer) and the `auths-cli` auditor (reader) share ONE
//! definition; this module is only the gateway-side append.
