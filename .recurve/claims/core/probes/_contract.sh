#   exit 0  GREEN   the desired behavior is present
#   exit 1  RED     the desired behavior is absent (print ONE detail line a
#                   sculptor can treat as the spec: "ours=X oracle=Y")
#   exit 2  BROKEN  could not measure (missing oracle/fixture/build)
#   anything else (crash, timeout) coerces to BROKEN — never to a verdict.

# Traps: when $TRAP_FIXTURE is set, the runner is feeding you a KNOWN-BAD
# counterexample from probes/<name>.trap/<fixture>/ — you MUST exit 1.
# A probe that has never been seen RED is not yet evidence.
#
# Probes are hermetic: build nothing, touch no sacred space, finish in
# seconds against already-built artifacts, no network unless the claim is
# about network. Oracles are pinned in harness/versions.lock.
